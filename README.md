# AR Museum Application

## Overview

This project is an Augmented Reality (AR) application designed for small museums to enhance visitor experiences. The application overlays museum artefacts with interactive digital content such as additional information, animations, and audio, making exhibits more engaging and educational.

## Features

* Privacy-focused, local-first design

## Privacy & Security

All data processing and engagement tracking are performed locally on the visitor’s device. No personal data is sent to external servers, ensuring visitor privacy and reducing security risks.

## Offline Support

The application is designed to function without an internet connection, making it suitable for small museums with limited or no connectivity.

## Project Status

This project is currently under development and is a work in progress.

## Purpose

The goal of this project is to provide a simple, affordable, and privacy-conscious AR solution that helps small museums create immersive visitor experiences without requiring complex infrastructure.
